# Automobile-DBs
This is a mini project Auto Mobile Data Base System Which Displays Infomation about the vehicle in the database and Infomation of the person owning the vehicle.
I used Bootstrap version 4 and 5 for the frontend and Python & SQL for the backend
I have database.sql file which contains all the tables required for backend, you can import in your XAMPP Control Panel or any other application.
requirement.txt contains all the packages which are required to run the main.py
templates folder contains all the html files which are used for frontend
static folder contains images

Feel Free to any good ideas.
