# Automobile-DBs
This is a mini project Auto Mobile Data Base System Which Displays Infomation about the vehicle in the database and Infomation of the person owning the vehicle.
I used Bootstrap version 4 and 5 for the frontend and Python & SQL for the backend
I have database.sql file which contains all the tables required for backend, you can import in your XAMPP Control Panel or any other application.
requirement.txt contains all the packages which are required to run the main.py
templates folder contains all the html files which are used for frontend
static folder contains images
Note : The Python version used is 3.9
Steps To Run :
Create a Database with name 'automobile' and import the 'automobile.sql' in the xampp server
Run the main.py script present in the folder
Make sure the apache server & sql is running on the xampp control panel

Feel Free to any good ideas.
